OBJ (or .OBJ) is a geometry definition file format first developed by [Wavefront Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_Technologies) for The Advanced Visualizer animation package. It is an open file format and has been adopted by other [3D-Computer Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics) application vendors.

The OBJ file format is a simple data-format that represents 3D geometry alone â€“ namely, the position of each vertex, the UV position of each texture coordinate vertex, vertex normals, and the faces that make each polygon defined as a list of vertices, and texture vertices. Vertices are stored in a counter-clockwise order by default, making explicit declaration of face normals unnecessary. OBJ coordinates have no units, but OBJ files can contain scale information in a human readable comment line.
